## How to Install 🚀

### Installing Both Ollama and Ollama Web UI Using Docker Compose

If you don't have Ollama installed yet, you can use the provided Docker Compose file for a hassle-free installation. Simply run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

This command will install both Ollama and Ollama Web UI on your system. Ensure to modify the `compose.yaml` file for GPU support and Exposing Ollama API outside the container stack if needed.

### Installing Ollama Web UI Only

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the latest version of Ollama installed before proceeding with the installation. You can find the latest version of Ollama at [https://ollama.ai/](https://ollama.ai/).

##### Checking Ollama

After installing Ollama, verify that Ollama is running by accessing the following link in your web browser: [http://127.0.0.1:11434/](http://127.0.0.1:11434/). Note that the port number may differ based on your system configuration.

#### Using Docker 🐳

If Ollama is hosted on your local machine and accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:11434/](http://127.0.0.1:11434/), run the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name ollama-webui --restart always ghcr.io/ollama-webui/ollama-webui:main
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to build the container yourself, use the following command:

```bash
docker build -t ollama-webui .
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name ollama-webui --restart always ollama-webui
```

Your Ollama Web UI should now be hosted at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and accessible over LAN (or Network). Enjoy! 😄

#### Accessing External Ollama on a Different Server

Change `OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL` environment variable to match the external Ollama Server url:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL=https://example.com/api --name ollama-webui --restart always ghcr.io/ollama-webui/ollama-webui:main
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to build the container yourself, use the following command:

```bash
docker build -t ollama-webui .
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL=https://example.com/api --name ollama-webui --restart always ollama-webui
```

## How to Build for Static Deployment

1. Clone & Enter the project

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ollama-webui/ollama-webui.git
   pushd ./ollama-webui/
   ```

2. Create and edit `.env`

   ```sh
   cp -RPp example.env .env
   ```

3. Install node dependencies

   ```sh
   npm i
   ```

4. Run in dev mode, or build the site for deployment

   - Test in Dev mode:

     ```sh
     npm run dev
     ```

   - Build for Deploy:

     ```sh
     #`PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` will overwrite the value in `.env`
     PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL='https://example.com/api' npm run build
     ```

5. Test the build with `caddy` (or the server of your choice)

   ```sh
   curl https://webi.sh/caddy | sh

   PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL='https://localhost/api' npm run build
   caddy run --envfile .env --config ./Caddyfile.localhost
   ```
